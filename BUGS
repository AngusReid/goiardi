* Many chef-pedant tests now pass. The authentication/permission related ones
  all bomb, though, when running in no auth mode. They do pass when
  authentication is turned on. Goiardi now has a forked chef-pedant for testing.
  There are a few areas where chef-server and goiardi both fail, but fail for
  slightly different reasons, so the forked chef-pedant makes goiardi-specific 
  testing easier.

* There are some go tests for pieces of goiardi now, although coverage could be
  better. Those tests tend to focus on internals that chef-pedant wouldn't
  exercise very well.

* At least after chef-pedant has run, there are extra files left over in the 
  filestore. This does not happen when uploading, updating, and deleting
  cookbooks, however.

* Presumably more are creeping around that haven't turned up yet.

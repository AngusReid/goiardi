* No test structure yet except for chef-pendant, which goiardi can run against,
  although it fails most of the tests right now.

* Authentication and proper private/public key handling is totally absent.

* Many chef-pedant tests now pass. The authentication/permission related ones
  all bomb, though, because of the total lack of authentication and permission
  checking, and there are a few tests that pass because of slight JSON
  formatting differences or error messages not being the same.

* Proper logging needed.

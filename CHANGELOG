0.6.0 (not released yet)
-----
* Postgres support.
* Fix rebuilding indexes with an SQL backend.
* Fix a bug where in MySQL mode events were being logged twice.
* Fix an annoying chef-pedant error with data bags.
* Event logging methods that are not allowed now return Method Not Allowed
  rather than Bad Request.
* Switch the logger to a fork that can be built and used with Windows that
  excludes syslog when building on Windows.
* Add basic syslog support.
* Authenication protocol version 1.2 now supported.
* Add a 'status' param to reporting, so a list of reports return by 'knife
  runs' can be narrowed by the status of the chef run (started, success, and
  failure).
* Fix an action at a distance problem with in-memory mode objects. If this
  behavior is still desirable (it seems to be slightly faster than the new way),
  it can be turned back on with the --use-unsafe-mem-store flag. This change
  DEFINITELY breaks in-mem data file compatibility. If upgrading, export your 
  data, upgrade goiardi, and reload your data.
* Add several new searchable parameters for logged events.
* Add organization_id to all MySQL tables that might need it someday. Orgs are
  not used at all, so only the default value of 1 currently makes it to the 
  database.
* Finally ran 'go fmt' on goiardi. It didn't even mess up the long comment
  blocks, which was what I was afraid it would do. I also ran golint against
  goiardi and took its recommendations where it made sense, which was most
  areas except for some involving generated parser code, comments on
  GobEncode/Decode, commenting a bunch of identical functions on an interface
  in search, and a couple of cases involving make and slices. All in all,
  though, the reformatting, linting, and light refactoring has done it good.

0.5.2
-----
* Add import/export of goiardi data through a JSON dump.
* Add configuration options to specify the max sizes for objects uploaded to
  the filestore and for JSON requests from the client.

0.5.1
-----
* Add log levels (from debug to critical). This makes -V/--verbose useful.
* Add an easier option in the config file to specify log levels by name.
* ipv6 already worked, but accidentally. Now it works in a more deliberate
  fashion, preventing mishaps with addresses, colons, and port numbers.
* Authentication protocol version 1.1 now supported.
* Remove a sort on run lists that was there for some reason. I have no idea
  what it was put there for, but it was wrong.
* Add an event log to log changes to objects like nodes, clients, etc. See the
  README or godocs for details.
* Add support for reporting (http://docs.opscode.com/reporting.html)

0.5.0
-----
* MySQL support added
* No longer redirect /environments/NAME/roles/NAME to
  /roles/NAME/environments/NAME
* Update documentation, reformat godocs
* Split actors apart into separate user and client types, made new Actor
  interface that encompasses both users and clients.

0.4.2
-----
Bugfix release:
* Perm tweak for nodes updating themselves.
* Small change with validating role descriptions when creating or updating
  from JSON.
* Fix issue with saving complicated indexed objects to disk where improperly
  flattened indexable objects were making the gob encoder puke all over itself
  when encoding the tries in the index docs.
* Fixed a possible regression with synchronizing cookbooks that did not show
  up in testing, but only in real use.
* An absolutely bonkers fix for listing cookbook files with webui. Webui wants
  all of the cookbook top level attributes sent over with a request to
  /cookbooks/<name>/<version>, but this is the exact *opposite* of the
  behavior chef-pedant wants, where empty definitions, attributes, etc. are
  not sent over. Knife also seems quite content with this, so the fix for now,
  since the two cases are mutually exclusionary, is to only send the empty
  hashes for those top level attributes with a GET if the request is coming
  from the webui. Bizarre, but it seems to be what's necessary.

0.4.1
-----
* Small documentation tweaks
* Fix bug with parsing config file options and rearrange setting some of those
  config struct items, fix typo in sample config file.
* Add disable-webui option for command line and config file to disable the
  chef webui rails app from connecting to goiardi.

0.4.0
-----
* Fix bug with pessimistic matching (https://github.com/ctdk/goiardi/issues/1)
* Add authentication, authorization as an option.
* Add SSL as an option.
* Fixed a few small bugs that turned up while working on authentication.
* Improved test coverage further, both with go tests and a forked chef-pedant
  (https://github.com/ctdk/chef-pedant)
* Updated and expanded documentation.

0.3.3
-----
* Data store and indexer tweaks.
* Improved test coverage.

0.3.0
-----
* Added ability to freeze data store and search index to disk.

0.2.1
-----
* Added support for configuration files.
* Fixed issue parsing flags with newer version of go-flags.

0.2.0
-----
* Initial widely announced release. First version with working search.

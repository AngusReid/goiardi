0.4.2
-----
Bugfix release:
* Perm tweak for nodes updating themselves.
* Small change with validating role descriptions when creating or updating
  from JSON.
* Fix issue with saving complicated indexed objects to disk where improperly
  flattened indexable objects were making the gob encoder puke all over itself
  when encoding the tries in the index docs.
* Fixed a possible regression with synchronizing cookbooks that did not show
  up in testing, but only in real use.
* An absolutely bonkers fix for listing cookbook files with webui. Webui wants
  all of the cookbook top level attributes sent over with a request to
  /cookbooks/<name>/<version>, but this is the exact *opposite* of the
  behavior chef-pedant wants, where empty definitions, attributes, etc. are
  not sent over. Knife also seems quite content with this, so the fix for now,
  since the two cases are mutually exclusionary, is to only send the empty
  hashes for those top level attributes with a GET if the request is coming
  from the webui. Bizarre, but it seems to be what's necessary.

0.4.1
-----
* Small documentation tweaks
* Fix bug with parsing config file options and rearrange setting some of those
  config struct items, fix typo in sample config file.

  chef webui rails app from connecting to goiardi.

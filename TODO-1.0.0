* Orgify metrics
* update vendor/
* orgify secrets
* orgify universe
* Check out s3 uploads that they'll actually work properly with orgs
* Figure out what happened to lists.go -- I think it got moved to different
  files
* Go over new functionality for org appropriateness in general. New items are:
	o secrets
	o s3 uploads
	o metrics
	o pprof info
	o in-mem search fixes
	o reindexing refactor
* sort out chefcrypto between 0.11.1 and 1.0.0-dev
* SQL funcs still need to be properly orgified
* Make an org-specific version of node.Count
* Document undocumented functions, methods, and vars
* metrics for universe?
* Check out import/export for org appropriateness - may have been done already,
  but may also need updating for things like secrets and s3 for orgs
* auth version 1.3
* Policyfile
* Update oc-chef-pedant to the latest code shipping with chef-server (pedant
  seems to have moved into there, IIRC)
* more go tests for new goiardi stuff

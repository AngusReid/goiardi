    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With the recent release of <a href="http://golang.org/doc/go1.3">Go 1.3</a>, Go now has <a href="http://golang.org/doc/go1.3#solaris">experimental support for Solaris and its various derivatives</a>. This means that goiardi will build and run on Solaris, although in an experimental way.</p>

<p>Unfortunately to get Go on Solaris/illumos/etc. you have to build it yourself from source, and at least when I was trying it out with OmniOS in vagrant it did not come with gcc by default. Getting go up so you can try out goiardi (if you don&rsquo;t want to <a href="https://github.com/ctdk/goiardi/releases/tag/v0.5.2">get the binary</a> is pretty straightforward.</p>

<ul>
<li>First, install gcc. <a href="http://omnios.omniti.com/wiki.php/DevEnv">These instructions</a> set you through installing gcc. It wasn&rsquo;t clear to me at first, but you do have to run all the <code>pkg install</code> commands mentioned. First install the appropriate version of gcc, then install those other packages.</li>
</ul>


<p>Once that&rsquo;s done, make sure your PATH is set per the instructions on that page.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Install git with <code>pkg install developer/versioning/git</code></p></li>
<li><p>Next, download go 1.3: <code>wget http://golang.org/dl/go1.3.src.tar.gz</code> and extract it somewhere. This will be your GOROOT. Set the environment variable with <code>export GOROOT=&lt;go's location&gt;</code> (assuming you&rsquo;re using bash or similar).</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The next steps come from <a href="http://golang.org/doc/install/source">*Installing Go from source</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In this new GOROOT, <code>cd src/</code>, then run <code>./all.bash</code>. It will build go for you. If it complains about being unable to find unistd.h, you were like me and forgot the second step on that <em>Installing GCC</em> page.</p></li>
<li><p>You want to actually be able to use go, so add it to your path: <code>export PATH=$PATH:$GOROOT/bin</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Now you need a workspace. In your home directory, run:</p></li>
</ul>


<p><code>
mkdir gocode
mkdir gocode/src
mkdir gocode/bin
mkdir gocode/pkg
export GOPATH=$HOME/gocode
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
</code></p>

<ul>
<li>Almost there. All that&rsquo;s left is running</li>
</ul>


<p><code>
go get -t github.com/ctdk/goiardi
go install github.com/ctdk/goiardi
</code></p>

<p>Assuming all went well, you can run <code>goiardi</code> at your prompt with whatever options you want, and it will happily run. After this point using goiardi is like using it on any other platform.</p>

    <link href="http://ctdk.github.io/goiardi/blog/2014/06/19/goiardi-version-0-dot-5-2-block-of-dirt/"/>

    <id>http://ctdk.github.io/goiardi/blog/2014/06/19/goiardi-version-0-dot-5-2-block-of-dirt</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Between the previous goiardi release and this one, my kids discovered Minecraft. This means that <em>I</em> started playing Minecraft, which ended up slowing goiardi development down for a while.</p>

<p>This blocky adversary has been overcome, however, and goiardi <a href="https://github.com/ctdk/goiardi/releases/tag/v0.5.2">version 0.5.2</a> is out.</p>

<p>Originally the next goiardi release was going to add Postgres support. This was about halfway done, and will be resumed shortly, but I decided that it was more important to add the ability to import and export data before any of the goiardi structs changed.</p>

<p>Changes in this release, from the CHANGELOG:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add import/export of goiardi data through a JSON dump.</li>
<li>Add configuration options to specify the max sizes for objects uploaded to the filestore and for JSON requests from the client.</li>
</ul>


<p>Importing and exporting is explained <a href="https://github.com/ctdk/goiardi#import-and-export-of-data">in the README</a> and in <a href="http://godoc.org/github.com/ctdk/goiardi#hdr-Import_and_Export_of_Data">the godocs</a>. Basically you add the <code>-x/--export</code> flag to your usual goiardi command to export the data to a JSON file, and run the <code>-m/--import</code> flags with your new desired goiardi set of flags to import the data. The administrator is responsible for removing any existing data (on-disk or SQL) and index files. This can help with backups or moving between the different storage engines goiardi supports, keeping data between upgrades, and should make testing easier in the future.</p>

<p>Also, per the README, there are new options to specify the maximum size of an object that can be uploaded to the filestore, and the maximum size of a JSON request from a client. The <code>-Q/--obj-max-size</code> flag gets the filestore object max size, while <code>-j/--json-req-max-size</code> sets the JSON request max size limit.</p>

<p>Completely unrelated to any of my efforts, but while I was preparing this release <a href="http://blog.golang.org/go1.3">Go 1.3 was released</a>. Goiardi and its dependencies build just fine with Go 1.3 with no changes. This also means that goiardi should be able run on some of the stranger platforms out there, like Solaris, the illumos based distributions, plan9, and apparently Dragonfly BSD. So far goiardi has only been build on OmniOS r151008j, but it built fine.</p>

<p>Finally, as an added convenience: on <a href="https://github.com/ctdk/goiardi/releases/tag/v0.5.2">the goiardi 0.5.2 release page</a>, precompiled binaries are being provided for download, if you don&rsquo;t feel like setting up go and compiling them yourself. As of this writing binaries are provided for Linux (built on Debian wheezy), MacOS X (built on 10.9 Mavericks), FreeBSD (built on FreeBSD 9.2), and illumos (built on OmniOS r151008j). The Linux, MacOS X, and FreeBSD binaries are x86_64, the illumos binary <strike>i386</strike> <strong>update:</strong> I misinterpreted the output of <code>psrinfo</code> &ndash; it was compiled for 64 bit. It appears that there&rsquo;s no reason that goiardi can&rsquo;t easily be cross compiled though, so a more sensible set of precompiled binaries will be coming soon. If you don&rsquo;t see binaries for your platform, try grabbing a binary that&rsquo;s built on a similar platform to yours, or compile it yourself.</p>

<p>Coming down the pipeline is resuming and re-merging the Postgres work, making some data structures safer for in-memory mode, some extra features for event logging and reporting, improving tests and moving away from depending on chef-pedant, and an idea I&rsquo;ve been kicking around for a serf-based pushy type thing. For those curious about the Postgres goiardi schema, you can see it <a href="https://github.com/ctdk/goiardi-schema/tree/postgres">in the &lsquo;postgres&rsquo; tree in goiardi-schema</a>. It&rsquo;s firmed up, but still subject to change before getting merged back in.</p>

    <link href="http://ctdk.github.io/goiardi/blog/2014/05/28/knife-plugin-for-the-goiardi-event-log/"/>
    <updated>2014-05-28T20:16:32-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://ctdk.github.io/goiardi/blog/2014/05/28/knife-plugin-for-the-goiardi-event-log</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There&rsquo;s now a knife plugin to use with goiardi&rsquo;s new event logging capabilities: <a href="https://github.com/ctdk/knife-goiardi-event-log">knife-goiardi-event-log 0.1.1</a>.</p>

<p>Usage info from the README:</p>

<p>There are four goiardi event log commands: <code>knife goiardi gel list</code>, <code>knife goiardi gel show</code>, <code>knife goiardi gel delete</code> and <code>knife goiardi gel purge</code>.</p>

<p><code>knife goiardi gel list</code> returns a list of logged events. A limit may be specified with <code>--limit</code>; the default limit is 15. An offset may also be specified; the default offset is 0.</p>

<p><code>knife goiardi gel show [id]</code> gives a detailed listing of a particular event log item.</p>

<p><code>knife goiardi gel delete [id]</code> deletes the given event, and prints out a detailed display of the deleted event.</p>

<p><code>knife goiardi gel purge [id]</code> purges all event log items with an id less than the given id. After purging the events, it displays the number of events that were purged.</p>

<hr />

<p>Being able to list events of a certain kind of action, type of object, time range, etc. would be nice and are on the roadmap for this plugin. Adding that capability depends on changes to goairdi before that can happen though. This plugin makes use of all the current event log functionality however.</p>

    <link href="http://ctdk.github.io/goiardi/blog/2014/05/26/goiardi-version-0-dot-5-1-rodan-overhead/"/>

    <id>http://ctdk.github.io/goiardi/blog/2014/05/26/goiardi-version-0-dot-5-1-rodan-overhead</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The sky darkens. Blotting out the sun, Rodan appears to destroy beloved landmarks and stomp on small models of tanks. Goiardi <a href="https://github.com/ctdk/goiardi/releases/tag/v0.5.1">version 0.5.1</a> has been released.</p>

<p>This is an incremental release, made up of bug fixes and relatively minor new features. The most interesting new features are <a href="https://github.com/ctdk/goiardi/tree/cc9aeb1766be7515458dcc6ad6e5260201b0e837#event-logging">event logging</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ctdk/goiardi/tree/cc9aeb1766be7515458dcc6ad6e5260201b0e837#reporting">reporting</a>, although the log level changes are also nice.</p>

<p>From the CHANGELOG:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add log levels (from debug to critical). This makes -V/&mdash;verbose useful.</li>
<li>Add an easier option in the config file to specify log levels by name.</li>
<li>ipv6 already worked, but accidentally. Now it works in a more deliberate
fashion, preventing mishaps with addresses, colons, and port numbers.</li>
<li>Authentication protocol version 1.1 now supported.</li>
<li>Remove a sort on run lists that was there for some reason. I have no idea
what it was put there for, but it was wrong.</li>
<li>Add an event log to log changes to objects like nodes, clients, etc. See the
README or godocs for details.</li>
<li>Add support for reporting (<a href="http://docs.opscode.com/reporting.html"><a href="http://docs.opscode.com/reporting.html">http://docs.opscode.com/reporting.html</a></a>)</li>
</ul>


<p>This release should not break old save files, if you&rsquo;re using that. If you&rsquo;re using MySQL, you&rsquo;ll need to deploy the sqitch changes.</p>

<p>The next big things to start working on are the long promised Postgres support, and etcd/serf/consul etc. integration. Groupcache has also been asked for and looks like a worthwhile thing to pick up. As always, the <a href="https://github.com/ctdk/goiardi/issues?state=open">issues page</a> is a good place to look at what&rsquo;s being worked on.</p>

<p>Goiardi is also starting to grow beyond using chef-pedant for most of its testing; it&rsquo;s about time to start more native golang tests for goiardi and not use chef-pedant for the main tests. It should always work with chef-pedant, of course, but goiardi&rsquo;s starting to get more features that chef-pedant doesn&rsquo;t check.</p>

    <link href="http://ctdk.github.io/goiardi/blog/2014/05/02/goiardi-version-0-dot-5-0-sturmisch-bewegt-now-with-mysql/"/>
    <updated>2014-05-02T10:10:55-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://ctdk.github.io/goiardi/blog/2014/05/02/goiardi-version-0-dot-5-0-sturmisch-bewegt-now-with-mysql</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Stormily agitated, a new goiardi release appears! Goiardi <a href="https://github.com/ctdk/goiardi/releases/tag/v0.5.0">version 0.5.0</a> has been released.</p>

<p>Aside from a few bug fixes, this release brings MySQL support. Now, in addition to running entirely in memory, goiardi can use MySQL for storing data. The <a href="https://github.com/ctdk/goiardi/blob/master/README.md">README</a> and <a href="http://godoc.org/github.com/ctdk/goiardi">godocs</a> explain how to set that up.</p>

<p>From the CHANGELOG:</p>

<ul>
<li>MySQL support added</li>
<li>No longer redirect /environments/NAME/roles/NAME to /roles/NAME/environments/NAME</li>
<li>Update documentation, reformat godocs</li>
<li>Split actors apart into separate user and client types, made new Actor interface that encompasses both users and clients.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Note:</strong> This release contains one breaking change. Saved data files from previous goiardi releases will not work with 0.5.0, so if you&rsquo;re in that situation either don&rsquo;t upgrade or remove your saved index and data files before starting up. This will regenerate your admin, validator, and webui keys, and of course nuke anything you had in place before.</p>

<p>Postgres support has already been requested by a few people, so that should be coming fairly soon. The <a href="https://github.com/ctdk/goiardi/issues?state=open">issues page</a> has been filled in with some enhancements that would be nice for goiardi to have. Feel free to add your own if there&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;d like to see.</p>

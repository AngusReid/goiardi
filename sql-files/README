Sqitch bundles for deploying SQL databases for goiardi are in here (currently,
the mysql-bundle and postgres-bundle). See http://sqitch.org/ for more 
information on sqitch, and goiardi's README for information on how to deploy the
sqitch bundle.

Additionally, for those folks who don't feel like mucking about with sqitch,
dumps of the MySQL and Postgres schemas are available. Create the desired 
database with whatever owner you want, and load the schema with mysql -u <owner>
[-p] <database> < sql-files/goiardi-schema-mysql.sql (for mysql) or psql 
-U <owner> <database> < sql-files/goiardi-schema-postgres.sql (for postgres).
